This repository contains the Closure Linter Now (Closure Linter fork with some issues fixed) - a style checker for JavaScript.

To install the application, run
   python ./setup.py install
   
Or simply execute (under root)
   easy_install https://github.com/39dotyt/closure-linter-now/archive/master.zip

After installing, you get two helper applications installed into /usr/local/bin:

   gjslint.py - runs the linter and checks for errors
   fixjsstyle.py - tries to fix errors automatically
